# Theme development Overview
You will find all the details you require in this document to work with others to develop the theme. Read through the document carefully before the theme development.

##### Theme Development Workflow
1. Describe the component on each page in words [(**`Design of each page`**)](#design-of-each-page)
2. Sketch out the theme design with paper and pen [(**`lo-Fi theme prototype`**)](https://github.com/Tianyi2/2023_SP51_CMS_GroupB/tree/main/lo-Fi%20theme%20prototype)
3. Create a hi-Fi prototype (**`Figma`**)
4. Develop the actual theme in code (**`wp-content`**)

#####  Before Your Theme Development
1. Look through the [(**`content`**)](https://github.com/Tianyi2/2023_SP51_CMS_GroupB/tree/main/A01%20Content%20for%20Students) provided by the client.
2. Check the team's progress according to the theme development workflow.
3. Develop the theme with the help of the previous prototype (for example, when creating the **`lo-Fi prototype`**, you should look at the **`Design of each page`**)
4. When developing the actual theme in code, please check the [**`deployment.md`**](https://github.com/Tianyi2/2023_SP51_CMS_GroupB/blob/main/deployment.md) for more information on code testing. 


## Theme Origin
..... (Where did we start the theme design)


## Theme Folder Overview
..... (Description of the use of each file)


## Theme Design
Based on the client-provided content, we build our theme. The content the client wishes to offer on the website is the first thing we look through and note down. Then, we use blocks to draw out the arrangement of each component. We build the theme in Figma and code it out after some discussions.
