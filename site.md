# site.md overview
This document explains the purpose of each page, its content, and how all the plug-ins are used. Additionally, this document describes how to add a new post, how to update the content on an existing page, and how the maintainer can use each plug-in. 

## Pages
##### 1. Index(Homepage)
The index is the home page of our website and the first page all new visitors see. The current home page contains four sliding heroes that each link to a different page via the buttons below, such as the registration page, the about us page, and a block at the bottom of the index page. If you need to change where it points, please use the WordPress editor. There are a few brief overviews of the Learning Centre from multiple perspectives in a self-questioning format below the hero design. In each overview section, there is a button that links to a page where there is a more detailed description. There is also a gallery section on the home page, where the client can update it in the WordPress editor. 

##### 2. About us
About Us is a page consisting of several images and text blocks. The first section consists of three interlocking parallel blocks of text and images, below each of which there is a button to locate a separate section below, for viewing teaching ideas, viewing our awards, and viewing our teachers. We have made tabs to choose between awards and the lastest news in in view of our awards section. The teachers who work at our school are listed below, along with information on their education and accomplishments.  A contact us button that takes the user to the contact us page is located at the bottom of the page.

##### 3. Classes
This page shows the subjects offered by the Baizonn learning center. In addition, users can view the cost of different levels of courses and class schedules. The block design below the class schedule is to encourage the user to register for the classes and link to the registration page.

##### 4. Registration
Advertisements for the Learning Center and a registration form containing the required information are included on the registration page. The maintainer can edit the registration form with the plug-in. 
  
##### 5. Contact
The contact page contains a collection of our contact information, including our phone number, email address, and learning center address. A contact form is also included on the page, which users can use to get in touch with the learning center. With the help of our navigation photos of several modes of transportation traveling to the learning center, users can easily find us. Finally, customers can view the exact location of the learning center on Google Maps. The maintainer may update the location of the learning center using the plugin.


## Posts
##### 1. Event:
The maintainer may show the event as a post instead of a static page. The post will contain a description of the event, time, date, location, and a button for the customers to book it. 

##### 2. Award:
The website maintainer may update the awards as a post that includes the award's image and title. It is also possible to include the day the learning center receives it.


## Plugins
##### 1. myStickymenu
It is a sticky navigation bar plugin, it can also be used to add a welcome banner to the bottom of the screen, which we can populate with a message, CTA, or sign-up prompt. The banner is sticky, meaning it stays on the user’s screen as they scroll. Users can hide this banner with a click if they’d prefer. The maintainer may add the event and promotion using the plugin.

##### 2. WPForms
WPForms is a comprehensive contact form plugin. Its drag-and-drop form editor and pre-made starter templates help us create the two forms in no time. All forms created using this plugin are responsive, meaning that they will work smoothly on mobile devices. They also come with hCaptcha and reCAPTCHA spam protection measures. Embedding any form to a WordPress page or post is easy, whether by using the included block or a shortcode. The maintainer may edit the two forms with the help of the plugin.

##### 3. WP Go Maps (formerly WP Google Maps)
This plugin is used to add a customized Google map to the website. The map shows the exact location of the learning center and the location of it at the top left corner. The maintainer may update the location with the plugin easily.

##### 4. Forminator
Forminator is a WordPress quiz plugin that lets you build forms, surveys, polls, and calculations. Thanks to its expandability and integrated features, we consider this the best quiz plugin for WordPress sites. Using Forminator, we can create two types of quizzes – knowledge and personality quizzes. In addition, it lets us choose between non-paginated and paginated quiz designs. The editor comes with a drag-and-drop builder that lets  arrange questions and answers easily. The quiz appearance is also completely customizable, from the layout and fonts to its colors. We can also add custom CSS and translation files to your quizzes.

##### 5. Connections Business Directory
Connections Business Directory is a free WordPress directory plugin for posting compelling information about your business location or staff members. The plugin lets us use repeatable fields to display information like address, phone number, and email. You can set each entry as public, private – for logged-in users only – and unlisted – meaning only administrators can see it.

##### 6. Visualizer
Visualizer is a table plugin to incorporate visual elements like tables and charts into your WordPress site. When creating a chart or table, we can easily import the data using a CSV or JSON file. Using the plugin, we can also customize the visual design of the charts, including the typography, texts, and lazy rendering. There’s also a setting for front-end actions to set whether users can print, save, or export the table or chart.
