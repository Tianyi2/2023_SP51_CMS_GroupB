##### 6. Visualizer
Visualizer is a table plugin to incorporate visual elements like tables and charts into your WordPress site. When creating a chart or table, we can easily import the data using a CSV or JSON file. Using the plugin, we can also customize the visual design of the charts, including the typography, texts, and lazy rendering. There’s also a setting for front-end actions to set whether users can print, save, or export the table or chart.
